# Converza Backend
This is the repository of the official monolith backend of the [@Converza](https://github.com/Converza) chat platform, which provides the logical functionality of the application. This backend uses the REST paradigma and the external authentication/authorization library [Trustifier](https://github.com/Converza/trustifier).

## Documentation
At the moment, the backend endpoints are only documented with the OpenAPI Standard over Swagger. The detailed documentation and usage information can be found on the [GitHub Wikipage](https://github.com/Converza/backend/wiki).

**At the moment the full API is not production-ready. All API endpoints can be changed with one commit and are unstable.**
